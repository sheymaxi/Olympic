ANALYSIS OF 120 YEARS OF OLYMPICS
The dashboard focuses on insights generated while analyzing the history of the Olympic tournament in 120 years with the focus majorly on the continuous closure of the gender gap in the tournament.

It suffices to state that women's empowerment is gradually having a groundswell in all notable spheres of sports. From zero appearance to a significant 27.5% appearance rate is commendable.

While I did not mention Larysa Semenivna Latynina in my analysis/report, she won 18 medals comprising of 9 Gold, 5 Silver, and 4 Bronze medals, making her the second most recognized participant in the tournament behind Michael Phelps with 28 medals.

I would like to stress that gender parity should not be confused with gender equality, as the former only takes into consideration descriptive measures only and does not involve value judgments or argue for policy changes in the way gender equality.
